Dear [Hotel Name] Support Team,

I am currently staying in Room 412 and would like to report several issues I have experienced since my check-in yesterday afternoon. I am bringing this to your attention so it can be addressed promptly, as it has been affecting the comfort of my stay.

Firstly, the air conditioning in the room is not functioning as expected. Although I have adjusted the settings multiple times and even switched it off and on again, the temperature remains warm and stuffy, especially during the night. This has made it difficult to sleep comfortably.

Secondly, I have noticed that the bathroom faucet is leaking, causing water to accumulate on the sink counter. While it is not a major flood, it is inconvenient and causes a constant dripping sound that can be quite distracting. I have placed towels around it to contain the water, but this is not an ideal solution.

Additionally, the in-room Wi-Fi connection has been unstable. The signal keeps dropping every 15â€“20 minutes, making it difficult to work on my laptop or attend virtual meetings. As I am here partly for business purposes, having a reliable internet connection is very important to me.

I chose your hotel because of the positive reviews and reputation for excellent service, and I truly hope this matter can be resolved quickly. Please let me know if a maintenance team can be sent to address the air conditioning, faucet, and Wi-Fi issues today.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your prompt response.
